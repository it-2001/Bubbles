# Bubbles!



if I remember correctly the controls are as follows:

  hold W - create walls
  
  press S - enable/disable statistics
  
  hold arrow + scroll - resize outer walls
  


But most importantly, have fun!

(I am not responsible for any bubble addicts that may or may not appear in the near future.)
